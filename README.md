# Heterogeneous_Signature

Algorithms:

BO_signature.cpp - Estimates the survival signature of a network system with two classes of components through bi-objective optimization

SO_signature.cpp - Estimates the survival signature of a network system with two classes of components through repeated single-objective optimization

IncSearch_signature  - Estimates the survival signature of a network system with two classes of components through an incremental search routine

Naive_signature  - Estimates the survival signature of a network system with two classes of components through breadth-first search.
