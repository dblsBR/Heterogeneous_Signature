# Heterogeneous_Signature

Algorithms:

BO_signature.cpp - Estimates the survival signature of a network system with two classes of components through bi-objective optimization

SO_signature.cpp - Estimates the survival signature of a network system with two classes of components through repeated single-objective optimization

IncSearch_signature  - Estimates the survival signature of a network system with two classes of components through an incremental search routine

Naive_signature  - Estimates the survival signature of a network system with two classes of components through breadth-first search.

Validation_Accuracy - Files used at the hipothesis testing and accuracy assessment.

Experiments_Results - Files corresponding to each of the computational experiments. For each experiment there are two txt files: one contains only the signature obtained in the experiment, the other contains a brief summary (in terms of running time) of the experiment.
